# Submarine Rock v/s Mine Detection-
This project uses machine learning techniques, specifically logistic regression, to differentiate between sonar signals reflected off rocks and mines in submarine operations. By leveraging a binary classification model, the system is trained on historical sonar data to predict the nature of underwater objects accurately.
