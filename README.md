# Submarine-Rock-v-s-Mine-Detection-
This project focuses on using machine learning techniques, specifically logistic regression, to differentiate between sonar signals reflected off rocks and mines in submarine operations. By leveraging a binary classification model, the system is trained on historical sonar data to accurately predict the nature of underwater objects.
